# Vide
**Vide** is a **free** and **open-source** tool for **Serial Communication Reading** and **Data Visualization**. 

Its purpose is to get _Input_ from a **Serial device** and generate an output for the **Plot Graphs** of the Application.

For example:
### Input
> varName1 552.23 varName2 23.202\r
### Output
**Vide** will grab each variable's name and value and create a **Variable object**. This **Variable object** can be displayed on a **Plot Graph** of the corresponding **Serial Port**.

## All started when I couldn't find a software that fits my needs. 
* The first one had to be bought after the trial, it had a really big delay when it was reading live values and it needed an **external Arduino Library** to read the values. I wanted something simple, without the need of unnecessary external libraries, just a **quick serial output**.
* The other one was just poor quality, unusable and much more complex. Why so complex? All I want is to visualize some values that we got from the Serial Input!

And they all were either pretty **complicated** and with **problems**. I wanted to make something simple that everyone could use and it would be great for a **High End** *AND* a **Low End** user. 

Something that could read many **Live Serial Data** and **Saved Data** simultaneously and visualize them in the way you like.

### I hope this products gets the love it needs.
